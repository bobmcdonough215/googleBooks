# Google Books Search With React

This is a MERN stack project that allows the user to search for books on Google's Books API. The user will enter a book into the search field and will be shown a list of book results that also include the author, a brief synopsis, an image of the cover art, and a link to Google Play where it is available for purchase.

After the results load, the user has the option to save a book to the database. This is a great tool for creating a reading list or a list of favorite books.
